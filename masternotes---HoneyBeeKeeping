============================================
1.1) General Beekeeping Knowledge
============================================

- 1900 - 1940's in the USA the state of michigan was the #1 producer of honey
    * dairy pastures of sweet clover
    * wild rasberries took over logged areas

- Langstroth hive patented in 1852
    * Key benefits were removable frames and bee space
    
- Beekeeping pollination services
    * California produces 80% of of worlds almonds
    * Almomds are the Worlds largest pollination service event
    * Almonds is lucrative crop so they can afford it
    * Approx. $200 per hive
    * California Central valley where almonds grow has major water issues
      they are dependent on irrigation
    * traditionally we use 2 deep for brood chamber and 
      medium supers for honey harvesting

- Bees move up in a hive naturally so we put brood chambers
 on bottom and honey frames up top
 
 - The climate your keeping bees in have a heavy impact on
 what is the best beehive type to use . In cold northern
 climates the traditional Langstroth style hive has advantages
 over horizontal hives like the Top Bar hive. The length of time
 and severity of winter has an impact eg. Northern Michigan in UP
 you have 4 to 6 months of winter so the bee's hibernate and move 
 around the hive alot.
 
 - The main objective of a hive is to shelter bees and provide 
 them with a cavity which they can efficiently thermoregulate 
 to maintain their brood nest within an optimal and narrow range 
 of temperature (34–35 °C); critical for brood development
 
 - Based on the wall thickness and type of wood used in the 
 Langstroth hive, its insulation value (R) ranges between (1.2–1.3) 
 while other newer material such as polyurethane provides much higher 
 value (6.2) in equivalent thicknesses
 
 - Hive insulation is crucially important during the winter time 
 when the temperature may drop below freezing. Honey bee winter 
 mortality remains a major contributor to colony losses worldwide. 
 In the USA, winter mortality ranged between 10 to 49% across States
 
 - Regardless of the outdoor temperature, honey bees have to maintain 
 their winter cluster at close to optimal temperature (34–35 °C). 
 This requires a significant amount of energy which bees generate via 
 thermoregulatory behaviors such as clustering, fanning, increase in 
 metabolic rate, and locomotor activity
 
 - In order to cope with extremely low winter temperatures, 
 indoor overwintering (McCutcheon, 1984) has become an increasingly 
 more common practice. For instance, in 2006, 25% of Alberta (Canada) 
 beekeepers overwintered their colonies indoor (Hartman & Nasr, 2007). 
 Despite its advantage in minimizing winter colony loss, indoor overwintering 
 remains an economical burden for beekeepers.
 
============================================
1.2) Hive Types
============================================

********************************************
Langstroth Hive
********************************************

- Designed to mimic natural wild honey bee colony hive behavior

- In the Wild honey bees often use trees and trees are vertical 
so the Langstroth hive growns vertically like a tree not horizontally
like other hive types eg. Top bar hive

- Proven to be most effective for beekeepers in colder climates where
the honey bees have lack of food and hibernate for long periods of time
as honey bees tend to move from bottom to the top as the winter progresses.

- With Langstroth hives 15% cold season losses is considered to be successful
in colder climates , this hive has been proven to be successful vs other hive
styles.

============================================
1.3) General beehive components
============================================

********************************************
Hive Telescoping Outer Cover Component
********************************************

- Outer most part of the top of the hive and is primary
purpose is to provide protection from the elements to the 
rest of the hive.

- The word "Telescoping" Comes from the idea that the outer
cover is sized where the inner cover sites inside the outer cover
so the inner cover "telescopes" / Folds into the outer cover.

- In contrast there is a cover type commonly called the "Migratory"
cover which is essentially just a piece of wood without the outer edge
that the tradtional telescoping outer cover has , this migratory cover
is primary used in commerical beekeeper apiaries where they frequently
move hives around so often will keep 4 to 6 hives right next to one 
another on a pallet for easy of picking up and moving , so it is important
that the hives can stack closely to one another without a gap.

********************************************
Hive Inner Cover Component
********************************************
- Primary purpose is so the outer cover doesnt get stuck
to the hive body boxes

- Bees propolize everything , so the inner cover protects
the outer cover from being propolized to the hive body.

- Key characteristic of an inner cover is to have an alternate
top entrance hole in the cover . We want a hive that has both
a bottom primary entrance and an upper entrance that is mostly
for wintertime , as bee's move up in the hive as winter progresses
so having an upper entrace allows them to easily move on warmer days
when in there hibernation cluster near the top of the hive.

********************************************
Hive Honey Super Component
********************************************

********************************************
Hive Frame Components
********************************************
- When choosing to use "foundationaless" frames the wires
hung in the frames are there not for the bees but for humans.
When we put the frames into a honey extractor machine if the 
wire's werent in the foundationaless frames the bees wax/comb
would fling everywhere so the wires are put in to give the wax
something to adhere to for when the frame is spun.

********************************************
Hive Queen Excluder component
********************************************

- A mechanical device places in between hive boxes to sequestor the queen to
a specific location in the hive , typically this is to the lower brood chamber
hive bodies which traditionall are 1 or 2 deep size bodies on the bottom of the
hive stack.

********************************************
Hive Body Entrance Reducers
********************************************
- september/octobor late season resources become scare so we use entrance reducer

********************************************
Beehive Feeders
********************************************

- Boardman Feeder
    - often sold with beginner beekeeper kits
    - uses a mason jar upside down on an feeder that sits at entrance of hive.
    - its nice to see the feed consumption to get an idea of how the colony is feeding
    - experienced beekeepers generally don't like as it induces robbing as its 
      in the entrace.
      
- Frame Feeder / Division board feeder
    - solves the robbing problem with outside mounted boardman feeders as inside the hive
    - Replaces 1 or 2 frames in the hive , hold larger volume 2-3 gallons.
    - large apiaries prefer these as easy to fill and hold larger volume and no robbing.

********************************************
Hive Body misc notes and information
********************************************
- A beehive deep frame body is approx 9 5/8" top to bottom
- A beehive medium frame body is approx 6 5/8" top to bottom
- A beehive shallow frame body is approx  5 11/16" top to bottom
- A Full Deep 10 Frame approx 100 lbs full of honey


============================================
1.4) Honey Bee Pests and Pest management
============================================
- AFB/EFB - American and European Foul Brood pathogens 
- Varroa Mite

============================================
1.5) Purchasing Honey Bees
============================================

- Sources commonly are local beekeeping clubs who organize a yearly purchase.

- There are 2 key ways to purchase them via what is commonly called a "Package" or "Nuc"

- Michigan most often come from Georgia or California , not many directly from local
michigan apiaries due to the short season and its difficult to do this at scale successfully.

- Packages are generall $150 per package , approx 3 lbs of bees with a queen , typically
sold in michigan market Aprial to early May.

- A Nuc stands for "Nucleus" its a small fully established miniature hive. Nucs approx $175 to $250
You can get in form factors of deep or medium hive boxes , most often 5 frame hive with drawn comb,
laying queen , brood and food. Typically Sold May through June. Gives you approx a 4 week headstart
over the package method which in cold climates is critical.

- Packages vs Nucs - Clustering in package vs drawn comb in a nuc very important for cold
climates . Head start on critical spring build up vs package , both are frequently ordered
November to March for bee provider planning and creation of the packages or NUCs. Unless
your starting your bees on drawn frames when using package's it reduces success rate in colder
climates.

============================================
1.6) Honeybee Biology
============================================

- Western Honey Bee - Apis mellifera

- Honey Bee is unique as it's the only widely managed insect by
humans. Humans are mostly responsible for the honey bee's proliferation.

- Apis mellifera has only been around veroa mite for approx 1940 so they
haven't co-evolved it is a relatively new pest to the western honeybee

- Key body parts are Head, Thorax, Abdomen

- keypoint: Handle queens from the Thorax the stronger part of the body due
to locomotion eg wings etc are here so it is a stronger part of the body.

- The abdomen body part is broken up into multiple segments that collapse into
one another.

- Antenna has 12 Segments that have 170 Odor receptors aka. chemo receptors

- keypoint: Insects and Plants communicate via odors , bees have a 170 odor receptors
that are highly sensitive and used for communication if this organ goes away the bee is
lost.

- The compound eye allows the bee to see number of Facets of the eye depends on the bee
cast eg. 4,500 queen , 5,400 worker , 10,000 drone . The eye of the drone is very large
this is to find the queen to mate with while in flight which is difficult so this makes
the drone more able to see the queen in the sky.

- Bees are very furry this is for Pollen collection. Pollen collection is a side affect
of Bee's function , the bee is positvly charged and pollen is negative charged so pollen
jumps on the bee while collecting nectar.

- Ocelli aka simple eye 3 simple eyes used for orientation to the sun , located just
above the compound eye. They are not for vision it is like a sun sensor on a car that
turns on headlights etc.

- Abdomon --> Spiracles
    * 10 pairs of spiracles
    * 3 pairs on thorax
    * 7 pairs on the abdomen
    * Spiracles are openings that allow air to enter and exit
    
- Forlegs , midlegs and hindlegs which hold the pollen basket

- Mouth - bees have both mandibles which are used for chewing and Proboscis which is like a straw
    * Mandible part of the mouth is used for chewing and manipulating wax
    * Proboscis is a straw like organ that is used for collecting nectar

- Central Nervous System :
    * Brain , Central nerve cord , Ganglia
    * Ganglia run down the central nerve cord
    * Ganglia are nerve centers of the body

- Circulatory System:
    * Open system no veins , all organs bathed in hemolmyph
    * Heart

- Respiratory System :
    * Tracheal Sac
    * Trachea

- Digestive System :
    * Mouth , Esphagus , Stomach/Crop , Proventriculus , Ventriculus , IIeum , Rectum
    * Honey stomach is not connected to the digestive system it is a storage vessel
    * The Proventriculus is like a one way valve that keeps honey stomach from digestive system
    * This is what keeps digestive chemicals away from the honey
    * Malpighian Tubulus is like a kidney , the filter waste out of the body
    
- Fat Body :
    * Very important to the honey bee
    * Anagolous to the liver , removes toxins from the bee
    * Key component to survive cold weather , ability to store fat
    * Varoa mite attaches to the fat body which is bottom part of the abdomen
    * Varoa mite feeds on the fatbody deposits so bee doesn't have fat to use during the winter
    * keypoint: In cold climates where 4-6 months of cold weather . If colony dies before Jan 1st most often veroa mite
    
- Flight Muscles :
    * Contract and Strech on the thorax that creates motion and flight
    
- Venom Sac/Gland :
    * On the tail end of the bee , when bee stings this organ pulls out and kills the bee
    * todo: keypoint: Apitheraphy - intentional stinging from honeybees for health reasons eg. arthritis

- Major Glands :
    * hypopharyngeal gland - Veroa mite impacts this
    * Salivary
    * Wax Gland

-  Honey Bee Castes :
    * Worker Bee --> Female --> 21 day life cycle
    * Queen Bee --> Female --> 16 day life cycle
    * Drone Bee --> Maile --> 24 day life cycle

*******************************************
1.6.1) Honeybee roles
*******************************************

-----------------------------------------
Nurse Bees ( 3 to 12 Days old )
-----------------------------------------
- fuzzy eyes
- light coloration
- weak sting
- Don't usually fly
- Located over brood
- Soft exoskeletons when first emerged
- Main focus is tending to queen , grooming nest mate, feeding larvae, capping brood cells for pupation

-----------------------------------------
House Bees (13 - 20 Days old)
-----------------------------------------
- Build new comb
- Hygienic behavior , removal of dead , mite infested or diseased brood
- feeding and transferring nectar or water - trophallaxis
- packing pollen beebread , ripening nectar honey invertase moisture removal
- capping honey cells at 17-18% moisture
- An "Undertaker" Bee role is a subset of house bees
- Remove dead bees and debris
- Food storage and comb building for other bees
- develop faster into forages than their same age peers

-----------------------------------------
Guard Bees (13 to 20 days old)
-----------------------------------------
- Primary job is Guarding the hive.
- They are triggered by vibration , odor , rapid movement.
- They are dark and fuzzy
- They can be observed ventilation and scent fanning with there backend in the air
- Thermoregulation Nest Homeostasis with brood present approx 95F , brood absent 55 degrees F
- Often seen Bearding outside the hive

-----------------------------------------
Foragers ( Oldest bee in the hive other than queen Greater than 21 days )
-----------------------------------------
- Gather pollen which is protein for the young
- Pollen provides protein , nitrogen , phosphorus, amino acids, vitamins.
- Pollen is collected on the "Corbicula" aka "Pollen baskets"
- Gather "Propolis" - which is plant resins used to seal cracks, entomb intruders, inhibits microbial growth.
- Gather "Nectar" - which is carbohydrates for all stages, collected into honey sacs @ regurgitated to housebee for storage
- Gather "Water" - Essential for hydrating and cooling hive , consume micronutrients from dirty water.
- Funfact - A "Forager" honeybee with a full honey crop/organ will double her weight

illness or disease. Apitherapy originated in ancient Egypt and has been 
practiced for centuries around the world as a natural and holistic approach 
to healing. Apitherapy Products A number of different bee products are used 
in apitherapy to address a variety of concerns.  Honey Pure honey has been 
used throughout history both as a sweetener and for its medicinal properties. 
Honey has a number of medicinal benefits including digestive benefits, wound 
healing, and oral health
